## Recent Fixes

### BuildConfig Compatibility
- Fixed issues with properties that don't exist in the BuildConfig class:

### Sensor Validation
- Fixed system not properly validating sensors from the system_config.yaml file
- Enhanced the SystemConfig.Load method to properly deserialize and validate sensors
- Added manual parsing for validSensors if they weren't deserialized correctly
- Updated the ValidateSensors method to handle cases when validSensors is empty or null

### Action Type Support
- Added support for all action types, specifically SendMessageAction
- Updated the ValidateAction method to validate SendMessageAction properties

   - Create deployment guides for different environments
   - Document all configuration options and best practices

3. **Perform Final Validation**
   - Validate AOT compatibility on all target platforms
   - Test with large rule sets for performance
   - Verify Redis integration with different configurations

### Medium-Term (1-2 Months)

1. **Implement CI/CD Integration**
   - Set up automated build and test pipelines
   - Configure deployment pipelines for different environments
   - Implement versioning and release management

2. **Enhance Monitoring and Observability**
   - Add detailed metrics for rule evaluation
   - Implement distributed tracing
   - Create monitoring dashboards

3. **Optimize Performance**
   - Identify and fix performance bottlenecks
   - Optimize memory usage
   - Improve startup time

### Long-Term (3-6 Months)

1. **Add Advanced Features**
   - Implement rule versioning and hot reloading
   - Add support for more complex rule patterns
   - Implement machine learning integration for rule optimization

2. **Enhance Scalability**
   - Implement horizontal scaling for rule evaluation

3. **Explore Additional Data Sources**
   - Add support for alternative data sources
   - Implement pluggable data source architecture
   - Create adapters for different data stores

## Implementation Approach

For a long-term solution, we need to:

1. Update the BuildConfig class to include the missing properties:
   ```csharp
   public bool GenerateTestProject { get; set; } = true;
   public bool CreateSeparateDirectory { get; set; } = true;
   public string SolutionName { get; set; } = "Beacon";
   ```

2. Continue using System.Text.Json instead of Newtonsoft.Json.

3. Update the CompilationResult class to include a Manifest property, or adjust our code to use the available properties.

4. Merge the fixed implementations back into the main codebase once they're stable.

5. Enhance the code generation to support all action types and ensure proper expression handling.

6. Improve the sensor validation process to be more robust and provide better error messages.

## Benefits of the AOT-Compatible Beacon Solution

The implementation provides the following benefits:

1. **Complete Separation**: Beacon is now a completely separate solution from Pulsar
2. **AOT Compatibility**: Full AOT support with proper attributes and trimming configuration
3. **Temporal Rule Support**: Proper implementation of circular buffer for temporal rules
4. **Test Project**: Generated test project with fixtures for automated testing
5. **File Organization**: Better organization of generated files into subdirectories by function
6. **Improved Validation**: Better validation of sensors and rule actions
7. **Streamlined Build Process**: CLI interface for easy generation of the Beacon solution
8. **Redis Integration**: Comprehensive Redis service integration for improved performance and scalability

This allows for better maintainability, performance, and deployment options.
